- **R2D2 Soundpack**: A custom set of sounds stolen from a Roborock Soundpack.
- **GLADOS**: Another custom set of sounds from https://github.com/Findus23/voice_pack_dreame.
- **Memes**: Another custom set of sounds using meme sounds.

Each soundpack is organized in its own directory.

## Scripts

Along with the soundpacks, this repository contains useful scripts to manage and customize the sound settings of your Dreame vacuum cleaner.

### Available Scripts

- **CreateSoundFromYoutube.py**: A script to download a youtube video, extract the sound and add it to a chosen soundpack.
